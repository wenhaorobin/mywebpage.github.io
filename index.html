	<h2><b>History</b></h2>
	
	<p>The museum began as an idea in the mind of founding CEO, Mr Chang Yang Fa. Driven by his passion for design and the arts, Mr Chang, who is an avid toy collector, imagined a space that is devoted to presenting vintage toys and childhood memorabilia – a space where visitors can also rediscover the past and revisit wonderful childhood memories.
	When Mr Chang founded MINT Museum of Toys in 2007, it was the first museum in the world known to be purpose-built for toys, and to date, it remains to be the only one. MINT was envisioned to be a world-class toy museum, with the objective of reaching out to the child in each and every person. Today, it continues to promote that belief.
	The building was also conceptualized to be a space that would provide visitors with a holistic experience. In 2007, the retail space, MINT Shop, and the dining space opened alongside the museum, promoting both the spirit of imagination and nostalgia. Later in 2015, the dining space evolved to become Mr Punch Public House, 
	a gastrobar serving modern European cuisine. The name took inspiration from the museum’s collection of Punch & Judy puppets. 
	The space doubles also as an enamel sign gallery.</p>

The facade was designed to exclude external lighting that could potentially damage the exhibits. It is also one of the iconic features of the building; made up of twenty-six glass panels shaped into a wave-like structure, the facade lends fluidity and movement to the building.We are housed in a unique and futuristic building out at the back of Seah Street.
